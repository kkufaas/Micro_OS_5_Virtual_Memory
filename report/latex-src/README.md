LaTeX Report Template
==================================================

This directory contains a report example/template using LaTeX
with the [IEEE paper style](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

You may use the structure of `template.tex` as a skeleton of your report.
But you must replace all content with content about your own work.

This template was created for the Operating Systems course (INF-2201)
at UiT The Arctic University of Norway,
but it may be useful for other courses as well.

Generating the Report PDF
==================================================

Requirements
--------------------------------------------------

To compile this LaTeX source into a PDF, you will need:

- GNU Make (Ubuntu package: `build-essential`)
- A TeX Live installation (`texlive`)
- The latexmk script (`latexmk`)

Build
--------------------------------------------------

To build PDFs, run `make` in this directory:

```bash
make all
```

This command:

1. Generates a corresponding PDF for every `.tex` file in this directory, and
2. Copies those PDFs to the parent directory.

Initially there is only `template.tex`, which generates `template.pdf`.
To create your own report, copy `template.tex`
to e.g. `report.tex` (which will generate `report.pdf`),
then replace the template content with your own report.

To clean up `.aux`, `.log`, and all the many other temporary files generated by
LaTeX, run:

```bash
make clean
```

Other Useful Files
==================================================

- The report template itself ([../template.pdf](../template.pdf))
    doubles as an introduction to TeX/LaTeX concepts and provides links
    to many other resources.

- The IEEE template is in the `Conference-LaTeX-template_10-17-19/`
  subdirectory. It comes with two helpful documents:

    - How to Use the IEEEtran LaTeX Class
        ([IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf](Conference-LaTeX-template_10-17-19/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf))
        explains the many options and commands that the template provides.

    - The IEEE example document
        ([conference_101719.pdf](Conference-LaTeX-template_10-17-19/conference_101719.pdf))
        is filled with advice typographic and grammatical details.

    Both documents are also examples of using the IEEE template.
